        This Webpage is created to demostrate my work and how to get in contact with me if interested. Im a very creative individual, with a key eye sight when it come to creating art peices in canvas and websites. 
        I may be a beginner when it comes to webdesign but I can be capable to learn and gasp the concept. My education level is two years of graphics design which gives me a head start when it comes to understanding modern art.
        In my journey of a web designer I want people to see and play with my inventions and imagination by creating websites and videogames.
        Since I was a young age I would create board games created by me and drawing. As well as, im very tech savvy since I tend to be in my computer most of my day.
